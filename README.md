*See our [Requirements Analysis Report](docs/SubmissionPDFs/RequirementsAnalysisReport.pdf) for more detailed information.*

## Objective
*Bryce George*

The development of a Social Interactivity Mentor for Youth with Autism using the NAO (SIMYAN) robot software platform. This platform will include an SDK supporting advanced social interactivity behaviors and a social interactive drawing module which implements the SDK for that specific scenario.

The solution will expand upon the existing NAO robot framework to provide capabilities for performing playful learning activities with human subjects. The activities should provide opportunities for the subject to learn human social skills and expression through interaction with the robot. The primary targets of a developed solution would be children with ASD, with the ultimate goal being to provide tools for the future development of activities which help them to advance in their social interactive capacity.

## Problem Overview
*Will Ross*

According to the American Psychiatric Association, “Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves persistent challenges in social interaction, speech and nonverbal communication, and restricted/repetitive behaviors. The effects of ASD and the severity of symptoms are different in each person” ([Copeland](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/autism/what-is-autism-spectrum-disorder), 2018). ASD is a relatively common condition in humans that can negatively affect social behavior and development. Children, especially those with ASD may have trouble developing the social skills necessary to find success is our social world. Thus, one proposed solution is the use of “social robotics” or robots aimed towards the development of social skills in humans. Our sponsor’s academic research focus is on children with ASD.

## Scope
*Bryce George*

Given the team’s limited medical knowledge of ASD and the techniques for its diagnosis or treatment, the following points remain out of scope of the current project:
* Development of an ASD diagnostic test
* Development of a therapeutic experience for ASD individuals
* Design or execution of a particular ASD-related research experiment
* Testing of a developed solution with any ASD individuals

Within the scope of the current project are the following objectives:
* Creation of a framework to aid the development and implementation of advanced social robotic behaviors to support diagnostic and therapeutic applications
* Development of a proof-of-concept behavior component to implement the specified social interactive drawing scenario
